### About my App:

This app makes an AJAX call to the GIPHY API to create a webpage that populates with zoo animals gifs when the user clicks on a button.  

### How My GIFtastic App Works

* The user clicks on any button to populate the webpage with 10 static gifs of a zoo animal of his/her choice.
* Next, the user clicks on any zoo animal gif to play it, and clicks again to pause it.
* Finally, the user types any zoo animal s/he would like into the form provided, and hit Add! to create a new button of a zoo animal of his/her choice.

### Technologies Used for this App:

* Bootstrap, 
* JQuery, 
* AJAX, and
* GIPHY API.
